I hope people can see whats happening with US based cryptos and Bitcoin,"Crypto investor since 2017, made good money, enough to quit my job in my mid 30s and travel and start a business and do other things I want with my life. Doesnt mean I know anything.

It is my belief that at some point, just like every other market, there will be a bust/selection period where 99% of projects become worthless. Of the remaining survivors, maybe 5-6 take up 80-85% of the market share, 5-6 take up 5-10% and the remaining hundreds or thousands of coins make up the last 5-10%

Example: Theres Verizon, Att, T mobile at the top, then theres tracfone and boost and mint mobile, then theres 100 that nobody knows anything about. There are 100s of brands of batteries but very few companies who actually make the batteries. Tons of tv companies, 5-6 that people know, dozens that we dont, 100s of other ones, and only a handful of huge manufacturers that make everyones tvs at the same place.

This is what will happen IMO because it always does, since forever.

And while I dont really care if youre a fan of the US or not, the US is the strongest economy in the world, and it is in the best position to harness this and benefit from it and control the direction of the space in the US and global narrative. Im not saying this is the best for crypto or the world, but I think it's ignorant to outright say it wont matter.

With the US and other countries getting on board with a strategic reserve, its clear bitcoin is and will continue to be a winner for the foreseeable future.

I believe this is also why we have the Dino/US coins pumping as their leaders have recently all been meeting together with some of them like Hoskinson even getting involved directly with legislators, meeting with senators, getting in front of congress and talking about what is best for us. Founders have all recently met, are all ISO 20022 compliant, and are all going nuts. I think this is a winning recipe for this cycle and for the future and I just want people to be aware of it. These projects **XLM XRP ADA HBAR ALGO** are outperforming a lot of other coins and I believe this is why, despite people starting to call them all irrelevant before this happened.

I am saying this because this is my third cycle in the space and have wasted time and money looking for pumpy coins when if I had just kept my money where I had it 7 years ago in these Dino coins (in XRP and ADA anyways), id have been proven right in my early conviction of these projects. Look at the narrative, research it, and make an educated guess. Do not ignore these trends and its ok to take risks on meme coins with a little bit of your portfolio but make sure you are on the right side of history when it all shakes out, because it will at some point in the not so distant future.",1732914715.0,1152,560,2024-11-29 21:11:55

Ethereum just hit a brand new 3.5 year low against Bitcoin. ,"ETH just hit a brand new 3 and a half year low against BTC after touching .03462 beating it's last 3 and a half year low of .03465 set just 8 days ago on Nov. 06th 2024. (.03462 means 1 eth is worth 3.46% of 1 BTC. )

In fact this means ETH has wiped all out gains against BTC since April 2021 when ETH was \~2k and BTC was around \~$60k. Since then ETH has completed the merge moving it from POW to POS and Proto-Danksharding (which dropped the gas cost on L2s). Still in comparing it's value against BTC, ETH has officially lost all of it's bear market gains.

Elon Musk: Tesla stops accepting Bitcoin as payments. Looking at other Cryptocurrencies that use less energy,"[Elon Musk latest Tweet](https://ibb.co/60xctB8)

On Wednesday Night, Elon Musk tweeted:

Tesla has suspended vehicle purchases using Bitcoin. We are concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin Mining and transactions, especially coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.

Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at a great cost to the environment. 

Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy. We are also looking at other Cryptocurrencies that use <1% of Bitcoin's energy/transaction",1620857699.0,27292,6101,2021-05-12 22:14:59

"Bitcoin energy usage IS a problem, and the crypto space would only benefit if everyone admitted that.","Let's be real, a lot of people here think bitcoin's energy consumption is not a problem, or it's just green people envious that they didn't make money.

The top rated post now is a post saying that banks consumed 520% more energy than bitcoin, even though the top comments are saying it's a bad argument, there still a lot of people who think the article is right, if you go on Twitter bitcoin maxis are always saying people are dumb because they don't get it how bitcoin is more efficient. Banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what, 200 million bitcoin transactions? You don't have to be a genius at math to see that there's no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions. 

I'm not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless. Those people work on different areas that you like it or not, are ""features"" bitcoin doesn't have, banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from A to B, you can't say the same about bitcoin, transactions = big energy output.  

""but defi is the future, we don't need banks"". You may be right, but if you look at sites like nexo/celsius, they are still companies with employees, they are competing with banks providing lendings, customer supoort, cards and insurance, not bitcoin. And they are doing fine.

""the media attacks crypto even though most a lot of coins aren't using PoW or will move to something else in the near future"". Hmmm, so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoin's energy waste? Sorry, but this is just delusional. 

Crypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms, and with more adoption it also comes spotlight. If you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure PoW, and bitcoin is still using PoW and consuming 10x energy from what it does now, you should think that's there's the possibility governments could act against mining, this year you saw hash rate drop with government-instituted blackouts in China, it wouldn't take much for countries to criminalize PoW mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting ""I'm the king"". 

TL;DR: bitcoin's PoW is a cow infinitely farting, there shouldn't be negationism in this space about it as everyone else is inserting corks inside their cows butholes.",1620191218.0,11177,2407,2021-05-05 05:06:58

Not to mention that we all expected BTC to become peer-to-peer cash, not a store of value for edgy hedge funds... It feels like we are going in the opposite direction when compared to the DeFi space and community-driven projects.


As far as I am concerned, the king is dead. The Billionaire Friends & Co are holding him hostage while telling us that everything is completely fine. This is not what I came here for and what I stand for. I still believe decentralization will prevail even if the likes of Binance keep faking transactions on their chains and claiming that the ""users"" have abandoned ETH.

Been buying bitcoin every month for 76 months now,"Started in October 2017 with the goal of 'enough bitcoin to retire'. Got the general idea from the FIRE community (financial independence, retire early) but instead of buying the S&P every month, I chose to buy bitcoin every month. So, basically I save as much as possible from every salary --> buy as much bitcoin every month as possible. When I have a stack of 1 million euros in fiat terms, I consider myself as successfully retired and most likely gonna quit my job. I document my journey in this blog that I try to update once per month, hopefully you like it interesting and motivating! And whatever your capacity and timing for stacking sats is, I'm pretty sure this kind of 'bitcoin retirement plan' is way more efficient than the government one, so starting anything similar is highly recommended.

This got me to thinking about the first time I heard of Bitcoin. I was a freshman in college and a computer science major. It was Fall of 2010. I was in the lab when a Sophomore csci major asked me if I wanted to help him set up the \~35 computers in the lab for mining Bitcoin.  His plan was to mine every night after classes ended until 8am when classes began again and 24 hours over the weekend.

Me, thinking it was a waste of time with Bitcoin being like $.06, said no. The guy ended up setting up the computers himself, mining \~2,000 BTC, and in 2013 when the price hit $1,000, sold half his stack to become a millionaire in college. 

Where were you the first time you heard of Bitcoin and what was the price per coin?",1665065689.0,5404,846,2022-10-06 14:14:49

No more price movement following the stock market, from now on we just dump no matter what, what a blessing to be part of this community and the crypto space!

Ethereum Classic and Bitcoin Cash are pumping...which means the latest batch of noob retail investors have finally arrived!,"I think many of you would consider Ethereum Classic a terrible investment, considering (1) it was the result of a hack, and (2) the hacker still has their bags of ETC available, which they periodically dump on unsuspecting investors. Bitcoin Cash doesn't have such a problematic origin, but might also be considered an unwise purchase given the lack of usage and development compared to BTC and other good projects.

So, when I open the charts and see that specifically BCH and ETC have been pumping hard for the last couple of days, my only conclusion is that new retail investment money has arrived and these noobs are dropping cash on 'cheaper' projects with the name Bitcoin and Ethereum in it. I should know, I did this exact thing myself earlier this year!

Here's hoping this signals the start of a another massive pump too.

(Looking at Syria, Venezuela.. etc) All those thinking they sit on a moral high ground calling for the hunger of millions of people are disgusting double standard subhumans that have no empathy for their fellow human. I've seen people dying of hunger in the streets and guess what ? The governments are still strong and standing cause this isn't a fairy tail where the good side always wins.

Double standard cause the US have done far worse than this in literally every war they financed and/or were directly involved with, yet if anyone mentions this they're accused of being Putin apologists.

I can't fathom how cruel some people can get and calling for the hunger of a whole nation because of the actions of their fucked up dictator !

Ripple is funding propaganda against Bitcoin by teaming up with the government to spread energy FUD,"Ripple labs has been funding ""research"" along with government entities to spread propaganda against Bitcoin and mining. 

In 2021, they funded a hit piece that claims energy prices for consumers in New York has increased by $6 per month because of mining. 

[Claim: Mining drives up household electricity bills](https://preview.redd.it/m0ta2tae4xb81.png?width=1318&format=png&auto=webp&s=8079d16b0fde7bc74ebd204d4362ff823da26d3f)

Surely its not the soaring costs of natural gas that is driving up electricity prices, but mining? 

[Since June 2020, Natural gas prices have gone up by 350&#37; in the USA \(Henry Hub natural gas futures rolling contracts\)](https://preview.redd.it/iprxvhfj5xb81.jpg?width=2610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4da2516b82eb585706d4d1af417320b5b82889e)

[Not just in USA, in UK, natural gas is at decadal highs. ](https://preview.redd.it/v2gl6rmx3xb81.jpg?width=3094&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9dae03fee6dfbbfaf58df82519db809462d01254)

Surely, electricity prices that consumers pay have nothing whatsoever to do with inflation, or soaring gas prices that are in decadal highs.. but is due to bitcoin mining?!

Crude oil WTI futures are currently at 84, for comparison it was around 56 in Nov 2019 (pre pandemic). The last time WTI was above 80 was all the way back in 2014. Increasing crude oil natural gas prices, along with inflation that is at multi-decade high is not the reason for increase in household electricity, but its bitcoin mining that is responsible.. 

[Thats according to this study funded by Ripple in collusion with the Department of Treasury. ](https://preview.redd.it/a4z5aqnyaxb81.jpg?width=1944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6656489541bece07a0e9b83837d42345157f987c)... The same Department of Treasury headed by another well known Bitcoin hater Janet Yellen, who earned $7m as ""speaking fee"" from the same banks she is supposed to regulate but has tried to stifle Bitcoin and crypto at every opportunity. 

Research with ""financial support"" is nothing but propaganda, especially when it's funded by a competitor to bitcoin that lobbies with the government. Ripple continues to be a centralised premine scam created to enrich its founders. 

Ripple has also cozied up with the likes of WEF, the very organisations Bitcoin was created as a fuck you to. [https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple](https://www.weforum.org/organizations/ripple)

As its price and narrative around the shitcoin has stagnated, Ripple is resorting to dirty political tricks to get a leg up. As usual, they will fail. 

The narrative that bitcoin mining companies cause increase in electricity bills in NY is rubbish, as the largest BTC mining companies in New York produce their own energy. Infact the last one to start mining in NY is a hydro electric plant that was unused for years, before they started mining Bitcoin last year. 

[https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php](https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Mechanicville-hydro-plant-gets-new-life-16299115.php)

The other large mining company Greenidge Generation also produces its own energy.


Edit: Buttcoin losers in comments say ""reee bitcoin move to POS or govt will ban it""

Yeah not too bright, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it cant be banned unlike the proof of stake shitcoins you support that can be created out of thin air at the press of a button and shut down at the press of a button.

Another one who is literally a war monger calling for Ukraine invasion but pretends to care about global e-waste. Lmao. Bitcoin haters are really a funny bunch


Edit: Ripple shills keep brigading and claiming where is the paper, of course if you are as bricked as a ripple fan boy you need to be spoon fed everything. Well here is the paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779720

And if you open up the first page of it, says

> **Benetton and Compiani acknowledge financial support from Ripple‚Äôs University Blockchain Research Initiative.**

i.e this whole ""paper"" is nothing but a hit piece propaganda sponsored by a competitor

The other writer of this paper is Adiar Morse, who conveniently works for the Dept of Treasury under Yellen: 

https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/prof-adair-morse-joins-biden-administration-as-a-treasury-department-deputy/

Seems like natural career progression - collect funds from Ripple to publish propaganda against Bitcoin, and get hired by Yellen who has been promoting propaganda against crypto for years now. Nothing to see here.

Final Edit: Jjust look at the number of freshly created ""Tin"" accounts that have popped up in the comments to shill for XRP. Didnt realize 2017 left so many bag holders. It must be real miserable with these heavy bags that are at 1/3rd of their 2017 ATH, while almost every other coin has gone up hundreds of % and made new highs this cycle. Thats what happens when you become exit liquidity for mccaleb, garlinghouse etc. 

Lol at the shills shouting ""REEE ripple is a company XRP is decentralised token"". They really did you good with this one small trick. 
Thats also the reason garlinhouse drives a shiny car while you are down 50% on your shitcoin investment. 

The D in XRP stands for decentralised. It was always a premined scam token and will always be one. Thousands of tin bagholders wont change this.",1642284900.0,3881,2654,2022-01-15 22:15:00

Been buying bitcoin every month for almost 4.5 years,"Started in October 2017. Thought I was late, everybody does. Decided to buy as much bitcoin as possible. Basically this means buying from every paycheck as much as possible. It's the FIRE type of investing but replace S&P500 with bitcoin. It's been going pretty well, a couple of crashes here and there. If you manage to keep your emotions at bay, there's no better way of accumulating capital (and freedom in your life). I started to document my journey in this blog. Hopefully it gives you motivation to do something similar!

Man who accidently threw away his computer filled with bitcoin has finally found it in the dump.,"After years of looking for his lost computer that he believed was filled with 7,500 bitcoins the man has found it.

the entire thing cost him around 2.5 million after paying for excavators, labor and city permits to dig up the landfill. He was relieved after finding the computer last month and had a professional data recovery company working on it for the last four weeks trying to recover his lost wallet, this cost alone was $400k.

Unfortunately it turns out the wallet was actually filled with bitcoin cash a hard fork of bitcoin worth a fraction of the price of actual bitcoin.

7,500 x $124 + $930k

so he is now about 1.6 million in debt to cover the cost of the loan he took out using the believed bitcoin as collateral.

That is just impossible, unless somehow they have developed ways to crack SHA256 and brute force wallet private keys. In which case, BTC is the least of everyone's worries and state/nuclear secrets could be under risk. 

[While Bitcoin isn‚Äôt stored on a server, the private keys to unlock the Bitcoin may have been.

And clueless media reporters are taking this to the next level by parroting and amplifying these distorted narratives.

[FBI can empty anybody's wallet. ](https://preview.redd.it/d0eup9f8f1471.jpg?width=1204&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e03f7dcdcf2a0252d84ce4217308a5de524b181b)

What rubbish, if FBI can empty anyone's wallet they can get BTC from the top addresses and all become billionaires themselves. This is some of the weakest FUD but people still seem to be falling for this.


Edit: Lots of comments seem to suggest that governments are developing or have developed ""quantum computers"" that can crack/hack bitcoin private keys. While quantum computers can definitely become a threat to cryptocurrencies in the future, they are not presently anywhere close to being capable of deriving the private key for a bitcoin address. 

As per u/BreakingBaIIs : 

> I did a back-of-envelope calculation that showed that it would be faster to mine all the remaining bitcoins 6 billion times than it would to crack a single private key using brute force.

> If the FBI found a way to efficiently crack a private key, that would mean they solved the most important math problem humanity has ever faced, that P=NP (in the affirmative). What they could do would go far beyond breaking all of the Internet's security protocols (which they could do). They would be able to solve all the mathematical theorems that humanity has ever worked on for thousands of years, plus many new ones we never thought about, in a matter of days or hours. They would be able to efficiently create superhuman AI using modest computational resources.

The complexity of cracking a single BTC private key is large and currently not in existence. 

Moreover, if such a powerful computer existed, it would be a threat to several other things rather than bitcoin and crypto. The entire internet runs on cryptographic encryption. Nothing would be safe. In fact, someone in possession of much less powerful quantum computing power can easily hack into Federal reserve and transfer out every dollar there, or hack into Bank of England and shut everything down. In other words, cryptocurrencies would not even be among the top threats, because much bigger and important threats would be easily taken over. 

If they had quantum computers, they wont be asking Apple to de-encrypt devices seized from criminals. 

If they have quantum computers that can reverse engineer the private keys to any BTC address, they wont bother recovering measly 60 BTC from the 80 BTC ransom, when they can just send BTC to zero by hacking and moving Satoshi coins, thus destroying BTC's narrative completely. 

Tl:dr - Its preposterous to suggest anything like this exists. While it is true that research and development on quantum computers is an ongoing topic, there is no evidence to suggest that such a quantum computing system exists today that can derive BTC private keys from just the addresses.",1623156401.0,6886,983,2021-06-08 12:46:41

You guys asked for it so here it is: I built a bot that buys Bitcoin when Elon Musk Tweets about it and open sourced it,"In my last post, you guys were interested in my bot project that buys Bitcoin when Elon tweets about it so here it is!

The bot was initially designed to buy Bitcoin when Elon Musk tweets about, regardless of the sentiment of the tweet. I have shared it with some smaller communities, and there was some great feedback on it regarding the main concern - what if Elon tweets: ""Bitcoin is too high imo"" and the bot buys at the wrong time.

So I found an API that would help me analyse the tweet sentiment, and integrated this into the code. The bot will now only buy Bitcoin when Elon Tweets, if the sentiment of his tweet is positive.

I have tested the functionality and the bot is quite stable, but I haven't tested how profitable (if at all) it would actually be, so if you're interested in testing it, please share the results with us! :)

The bot was built mostly for fun, and I wouldn't encourage you to trade with it on a live account! But if you want to have some fun with it and try it out on a demo account, here you go:

"If You Can Hold a 401K Plan for 30-40 Years, You Can Hold Bitcoin for 3-4 Years.","You also only have to buy into BTC once, unlike a 401K where most people keep buying back in every pay check only to lose what you earned in interest by paying a penalty if you withdraw too early.   Because that's the trick.  The trick to a 401K is to get everyone to hold because if everyone sells, then everyone else who didn't sell fast enough will lose money and the whole thing will crash.    That's why they charge penalities.    

It's like investing in safemoon and they charge you penalities for selling In order to keep the current value more stable so the entirety of holders don't start panic selling it into oblivion.

Also you can panic sell a 401K too.  It happened to many people after the housing market crash of 2008.    My mom panic sold her 401k because it went from $50K to $9K ...I didn't know much about investing back then, but I will never forget what she said.  *I was afraid I would lose it all, it kept going down* 

What she said sounds much like what people say about Bitcoin today. 

Nowadays my mom is retired, and sometimes she brings that up...*I should've just kept it in...it went back up*

Unfortunately this is how the most powerful people work.  They shake out weak hands so they can buy up super low.   Otherwise there would be no big guy buying your shit back.  

Rich are buying your shit cheap for a reason...not just because they are just speculating. 


So yeah, you can get serious FUD with 401K and it's not just coming from my mom. Many honest hard working people don't understand the game whales play...they get shilled into things and are convinced it's safe because their employer offers it.    All a 401K is, is investments into stocks and bonds that are stable but not always safe. 

So if you can continually dump every paycheck into something that penalizes you for withdrawing early and hold that shit for 30 years , then you can buy Bitcoin  once and hold it for 3 years without any penality for withdrawing some too early unless tax on capital gains. But that's normal. 

So stick to your original plan, and hold.",1622308958.0,6814,902,2021-05-29 17:22:38

TIL: there used to be a Bitcoin faucet that literally gave away 5 bitcoins just to solve a CAPTCHA,"12 years ago in 2010 a fellow named Gavin Andresen created the first cryptocurrency faucet;  he made this simple website giving away 5 bitcoin ( not a typo FIVE)  just for solving a CAPTCHA.  It has since been archived and what is crazy was that the snapshot on that day showed that there was still 750 Bitcoin to give away.  5 Bitcoin is basically 100,000 USD in todays price and at its all time high this would had equate to 325,000 just for visiting a website.

From wikipedia source: Gavin Andresen is a bitcoin pioneer and was one of the few developers that actually developed alongside with Satoshi Nakamoto who declared him as the lead developer for the client bitcoin software.  Been quoted,  ""Bitcoin is designed to bring us back to a decentralized currency of the people,"" and ""this is like better gold than gold.""  He also conceived of the Bitcoin Foundation but sadly he stopped contributing in 2016 and criticize bitcoin developers for not increasing network capacity and later got involved in bitcoin cash instead.

I went to the supermarket here in Venezuela and paid directly with Bitcoin,"Hi guys, as you probably know I'm Venezuelan living here.

Yesterday I had the chance of doing some purchases in a supermarket and paying directly in Bitcoin.

This was the purchase:

[The purchase \(I had purchased some things before, like fruits and vegetables in farmers market and chicken\/meat\)](https://preview.redd.it/skjk96ln8poa1.jpg?width=780&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fe20196dd1ee8b4e8b67bf1ec4116efae4b7d44)

&#x200B;

You say to the cashier you want to pay in cryptocurrency and their system shows them a selection:

&#x200B;

[The amount is shown in Bolivares \(Bs.\) so 725 Bs.  so 30 USD \(exchange rate is 1 USD 24.2 Bs.\)](https://preview.redd.it/mrh1wr9h9poa1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bd605c13966f94dee1cd3b37aff10619b5ea96a)

They say they will add more crypto and BTC LN.

After selecting bitcoin and and continue (Continuar) it shows the amount in bitcoin

&#x200B;

[So that is, 0.00124813 BTC, yesterday it was very volatile so even when BTC was around 27,200 USD using that rate I paid around 34 USD. Not much sense there, 4 USD more I suspect it s a fixed fee, wouldn't make sense be 10&#37;. After I took the picture he went again there and final price was 0.00124863 BTC.](https://preview.redd.it/74ejomjz9poa1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a26782597706df63ea58256b28fbcb9287ec0a1)

After that it shows a QR code, you scan it and have to wait for at least one confirmation after you get one confirmation (mine took several minutes) the cashier press payment received and I suppose it checks one blockchain explorer for one confirmation or pending transaction that matches the amount. If it matches it says payment received and receipt is printed.

I noticed each time you press continuar a new QR code gets generated, so new or different address.

I used Trust Wallet and the fee was 1.36 USD.

Receipt is shown in Bolivares, but that is common here even if you pay with USD, Euros or any currency the invoice will be printed in Bolivares.

Experience was good overall, but in this case I paid a little more, something to improve.

You have to remember that here the economy is destroyed:

&#x200B;

* Monthly inflation can be over 10% easily. Being it under 10% is a success.
* Monthly minimum wage is 130 Bs. (less than 5 USD, this purchase was 5x monthly minimum wage), average monthly wage is 120 USD.
* Since 2007 14 zeroes were removed from the currency, so this 725 Bs would have been 72,500,000,000,000,000

 This is likely an OTC deal and does not directly affect the BTC spot price. They still hold 179.19K BTC ($11.7B) in the old wallets. 

Details: [https://platform.spotonchain.ai/en/entity/188?route=view\_transaction&chain\_id=2110000000&txn\_hash=b614dd2e0fa06d776ee4d45973fab5ceb6e2dfebfb84e5f7bd45ef0975455240](https://platform.spotonchain.ai/en/entity/188?route=view_transaction&chain_id=2110000000&txn_hash=b614dd2e0fa06d776ee4d45973fab5ceb6e2dfebfb84e5f7bd45ef0975455240)

&#x200B;

 Now the crazy part about this story is that they transferred 30,170 Bitcoin (approximately $2 billion) with no regulations or paperwork like the bank does. 

 Imagine if you wanted to transfer that amount of money by using the bank üòÇ, they would have freaked out and asked you everything about this transaction. They would need to ask their bosses to come and see you directly, and you would have to sign A LOT of papers to get through with **YOUR MONEY.** Not to mention about how much the fee is and how long you could have waited for this amount of money to actually be ""processed"" and ""completed"".

&#x200B;

 If I were to risk losing my money between the bank and cryptocurrency, I would choose cryptocurrency because I can have control over it. I wouldn't have to wait for the bank to retrieve it for me or follow their instructions on what to do next, especially since they can be unreliable. 

What side are you on?

The OP follows and RTs stuff like this

https://nitter.net/Quinnvestments/status/1446262224520105987?s=20


This quinn investment guy is a known fraudster who cooks up conspiracy theories, just have a look at his profile lol. 


Bullshit that has already been denied, like Tether holding Evergrande.. 
Infact this nonsense claims 78% of Tether reserves are Evergrande, which is total lies.

And that OP RT's nonsense like this, wishing for crypto to burn, but you all are assuming he is posting his ""unbiased opinion"" on bitcoin law. Lol


Edit:

Some comments are pointing out that I havent deboonked what that OP has said. I did actualyl debunk him last month, but then realised he isnt having honest debates but is just putting out propaganda. Given that he isnt acting in good faith, and is a buttcoiner, kinda pointless for me to debunk moreover, he is clearly lying that he wants to see crypto succeed, and instead has a very biased agenda. He is not debating in good faith. If you check his profile, he had posted that BTC would be a failure even before the roll out. Literally, before the plan was implemented and went live, he claimed it would be a failure. Anyone really expect this guy to be unbaised at this point? 

Coming to the protests, yes there are protests, but the protests are to do with politics rather than bitcoin. You will find one or two guys carrying an anti-bitcoin banner in the entire protest. Most of the protests are purely due to political reasons, that have nothing to do with Bitcoin. All those pictures he has posted as proof are all from protests shared on twitter, they have nothing to do with bitcoin except that fact that Bitcoin is implemented by the president, against whom all the protests are targeted. 

That guy claims Bitcoin rollout is ""not going well"". 

Stats from Google app store and IOS app store prove him wrong. 

The Chivo wallet is still #2 on ios app store, ahead of most viral apps like FB/ Whatsapp/Twitter/TikTok etc

https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/apple/store-rank/sv/all/


And on Android play store, the wallet is the #1 app too..

https://www.similarweb.com/apps/top/google/store-rank/sv/all

The Chivo app is pretty much TOP on both app stores. Quite some failure huh! Definitely not doing well...

Just because there have been some issues during rollout doesnt mean its a failure or its not going well. Many mass implementation programs have problems initially, infact even the US covid stimmy checks took a while to arrive and there was implementation delays. Later, [WaPo reported that over 1 M checks went out to dead people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/06/25/irs-stimulus-checks-dead-people-gao/). Was that a failure too? 

Now lets look at some real stories that are success:

Over 3 million  users have downloaded the wallet. 

[More users in El Salvador are now using Chivo / have a bitcoin wallet than they have traditional bank accounts.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2021/10/07/in-el-salvador-more-people-have-bitcoin-wallets-than-traditional-bank-accounts/?sh=7ac1bb5020b5) - This alone is a massive win, in a country where huge amounts of people are unbanked, they have now instantly been given access to the world's most open and fair financial network. 

 Already, Brazil is considering following El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as well.


A country implementing BTC is not a race to the finish, it is a long term program. OP knows that too, but since he is a biased propagandist, he wants to put out hit pieces on a monthly basis

Bitcoin was supposed to be the solution to BIG MONEY. Now it instantly dips everytime when the stock market dips.,"To be honest, this makes me sad.

As far as I remember, Bitcoin was thought to be the solution of the fact that institutions, wall street and big money control the financial world and the pennies of the simple people from the normal population. And it was more or less like this, in the first several years after the inception of Bitcoin. We saw so much price discovery, Bitcoin being volatile, because mere mortals like us were buying, hodling, selling, wondering how much the *real* price of this asset is. It was literally supply and demand, controlled only by the psychology and the individual decisions of every single one of us.

What do we see nowadays? We go to bed, we wake up and we see that Bitcoin is at -10% for no reason. Literally for no reason. Neither me or you have sold. We were just sleeping. What happens? Bitcoin is strongly tied to the trading algorithms of insitutions and they handle it the same way they handle stocks. If the stock market is supposed to move down, bitcoin and crypto in general follows instantly in a nanosecond. We are not in control anymore. It doesn't matter if we buy or sell.

During the last few years, we welcomed institutional interest and we cheered. Now I realize that they have much more power than us and the situation is the same as it has ever been - big money controls the pennies, or in this case the satoshis, of us - the simple people.

It makes me sad, but in the end, this is an open and free market. Everybody has the right to buy, sell or hold as much as he or she wants. In this case, it just happens so that the big players choose to be massively invested in crypto, which gives us the spot on the sidelines - sit and observe how the price fluctuates, without being able to react on our own.

EDIT: I agree with a lot of you guys and girls. The same way sometimes we go to bed, wake up and see that Bitcoin is +15%. In those green days, nobody complains about it. What concerns me in overall is how tied the price movement of crypto assets to the price movement traditional assets is. I am not sure if this is an issue to be concerned about. However, it's a fact and I feel the necessity to talk about it and discuss it's impact.

EDIT 2: wow, thanks for the amazing discussion! I appreciate that so many people participate in it and share their view on the topic.",1642761686.0,3062,1245,2022-01-21 10:41:26

When looking up his background information, everything looks legit. This is probably what Biden's advisor meant when he said that his administration was mining Bitcoin, because from what I've heard this kid say in those twitter spaces, the stuff he's trying to do for them would involve mining and much more. His plan is to make Bitcoin the GPS and Atomic Clock of digital information, a solid accurate ledger to store important information away from things like internet rot or wiki edits.

For those who don't know, our current internet is rotting away. When you search on google, it claims to have billions of results for any subject, but when you search through those subject's results and actually dig through the pages, you only get on average around 350 to 470 links.

The other billions? They've been lost to internet rot, the result of links being lost or destroyed from things like servers going offline, losing the data of billions of results per search, the loss of things you used to be able to find online but can no longer locate.

This apparently is a problem for the government as a lot of those lost links were links used in actual court cases, leading to digital evidence being lost that in some cases have been used to set legal precedents. There's a lot more to what he's doing for the military via the usage of Bitcoin's immutable ledger, but this is what I can remember off the top of my head.

Hopefully he can set up an AMA with the mods one day. I bet this community would be very interested in hearing what he has to say in regards of what he's doing with using Bitcoin's immutable blockchain on the most powerful computer network on earth for the Space Force and the Defense Department's needs.

Nano is a scam that was premined at the press of a button, distributed among themselves by Colin using funny faucets where the insiders themselves claimed most of the tokens, then abruptly the faucet was closed, the team now having control of most of the coins decided to pump it to yahoo land on a fraudulent exchange and ride into the sunset while also cashing out slowly for years. No wonder Nano price has never even recovered past its early 2018 ATH, after 4 years its still down a huge % from ATH. (thats what happened when you have an endless premine ready to dump on you). Nano peddlers are pushing this as a competitor to BTC lmao. A stablecoin like DAI or USDC on any ETH L2 solution renders Nano as useless.

I analyzed the Last 3 Bitcoin halvings here's what I think will happen after the 2024 halving,"Hi

If you've never experienced a Bitcoin halving before, or if you have but are unsure what to expect, I've done a bit of research based on the last halvings. Here's what i have. 

The halving occurs every four years, cutting the reward for mining new blocks in half. The next halving will reduce rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 BTC.

Historical Price Impacts:

* 2012 Halving: Bitcoin's price surged approximately 9308% in 13 months.
* 2016 Halving: Saw a 2861% increase over 17 months.
* 2020 Halving: Resulted in a 620% increase in 11 months.

Based on some napkin math the BTC can reach a 162% price increase post-halving, with the peak expected around 420 days (14 months).

inb4 no one knows shit about anything. It's a probability game.

What's your take.

13 years ago the lowest Bitcoin selling price ever was recored at $0.003 cents. 160 BTC were sold for literally 48 cents.,"We all know that Bitcoin was not always even nearly as high valued as today o even 5 years ago. There were even times when we had no real Bitcoin price chart and no way to actually now the current value of one Bitcoin, so the price was usually made by sell offers that went up for certain amounts. One of earliest ones happened on February 20th 2010.

On that date someone sold 160 BTC that he/she mined with just the use of 1 kWh energy, for the lowest price ever recorded at $0.003 cents as that person thought Bitcoin to be overvalued at 5 cents during that time. Now those 160 BTC would be worth $4M and at the ATH even $11M.

This is what happens to Bitcoin when options expire each month.,"The biggest ever Bitcoin options expiry is due on March 26. Over $6 billion worth of Bitcoin options will expire across exchanges on Friday, at 4pm UTC to be precise. This will be a record expiry in terms of  the value and number of options, a total of 100,400 Bitcoin options  will expire. The previous record was set in January when nearly $4 billion worth of options expired, representing 36% of the open interest at the time.

But after each expiry this happens. So strap on for some serious action next week and beyond.

I think I finally understand bitcoin.,"It's a silent project that operates in the background. There's no face to it. The founders created it and walked away. It's like an elegant clock set into motion that continues to tick. There's no promise of some complex protocol to come 3, 5, or 10 years down the road. It does what it's supposed to now without self promotion from the founders. Since it doesn't need self promotion to thrive, it doesn't fall victim to the vices of marketing from greedy, charismatic leaders, with overly complex projects. Sure, there's Saylor and Novogratz that sometimes fall into that role. But bitcoin doesn't need them to survive and won't need them when they die. The project works now. It does what it's supposed to and it'll continue to do what it's supposed to. It's the money of the future of our science fiction novels.

There's no Krypto Kris marketing shitty debit cards. There's no charismatic Do Kwon doing a Forbes, Steve Jobs photo shoot with a black t-shirt and a white background. There's no J Powell magically expanding the money supply with a cobol fueled wand, creating a 9 trillion USD balance sheet out of thin air.

BTC takes out the corruption of humans, because the humans that created it stepped away. Sure, people will build corrupt systems around it, but BTC itself is a simple, pure, and elegant vehicle silently ticking away in the background until the ticking becomes so loud that no one can ignore it.",1652365081.0,2279,921,2022-05-12 14:18:01
Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency was invented in the first place.," 

* People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.
* Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.
* Banks  gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran  ‚Äúfractional reserves‚Äù. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks  collapsed because of runs on the bank.
* Central  banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort.  Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other‚Äôs  deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered.  Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all,  banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.
* Banks  would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient  trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments  would have to step in to save them.
* All  ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when  Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed  amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now  effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks  could create.
* From  this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be  supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and  lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to  them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But  these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And  reserves are much lower than the loans they make.
* This  led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped  reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in  the supply of the euro of about 5%.
* This  leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat  lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of  increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper  all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices  to drop every year. That they don‚Äôt is the effect of money creation.
* What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.
* Banks  have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase +  2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish  this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting  this money returned to them at an interest.
* Apart  from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every  couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or  the system will collapse.
* Apart  from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away  with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to  exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to  transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.
* The  absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were  force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and  silver remain difficult to use.
* When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals  (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined  the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only  thrive if ‚Äúnobody‚Äù launched it and if they was no central point of  failure.
* What  was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what  Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the  problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with  the text: ‚Äú03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for  banks.‚Äù. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial  system.

So, if you find  yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency‚Äôs price, or bogged  down in discussions about the ‚Äúone true bitcoin‚Äù, or constantly asking  what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.

We are here to fix the financial system.",1622070603.0,3985,697,2021-05-26 23:10:03
"If people who created Buttcoin sub on the day they created it decided to invest $100 in Bitcoin instead that day and not sell, they would have $211k worth of BTC now","So that subreddit which is just a community of BTC and crypto haters was created on 18th of July in 2011.

El Salvador has officially passed a law that makes Bitcoin a legal currency.,"And that‚Äôs a wrap ladies and gentlemen. On June 9, 2021, at approximately 12:08am EST, El Salvador has become the First Nation to pass a bill that makes Bitcoin a legal currency. Who would have thought this would happen so quickly!  It will take ~90 days for this law to be enacted; presumably to allow merchants and others to prepare for the acceptance and transmission of bitcoin. 

It‚Äôs also important to remember that the people of El Salvador have been using bitcoin and it‚Äôs lightning network for some time now. This has helped with the quick majority approval of the bill.

"While everyone focuses on Saylor and El Salvador, the number 1 Bitcoin degen is actually Bhutan","Here are some facts and statistics about Bhutan I pulled out:

*  Bhutan holds 1/3 of its entire GDP in Bitcoin, 13k Bitcoins in total
* The 13k Bitcoins is more than 2x El Salvador's holdings, and El Salvador has over 6 million citizens compared to 750k for Bhutan. So ""BTC holdings per capita"" is close to 20x for Bhutan compared to El Salvador
* Bhutan started getting into the crypto space in 2019, with BTC mining. This is before the hype phase in 2021.
* They mine BTC through hydroelectric power (clean energy). Once again ahead of the game and they don't need to spend millions of money/stonks like SaylorMoon or El Salvador. End 2021, they quietly started construction on the largest ever mining site while the buzz was around El Salvador buying BTC.
* So basically they are using BTC as a true ""revenue stream"" where a large part of their holdings are truly in BTC. You can think of Bhutan as your typical crypto degen, but instead as a crypto bro it is a country version of it.

Why do y'all think despite all these great use cases and being the first country ever to truly hold an enormous % of their GDP in Bitcoin, Bhutan does not have the attention?
